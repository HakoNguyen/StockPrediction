The product is our entry for the AI Challenge hosted by RIPT for the D23 cohort. While it still has some limitations, it reflects the dedication and countless sleepless nights of our team, as well as our efforts in selecting algorithms and exploring innovative directions. We hope that you will view our work with an open and positive mindset. We are always eager to receive feedback and suggestions to improve and enhance our product.
